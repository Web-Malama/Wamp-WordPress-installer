## **Background**
Simple WordPress Auto Installer for [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/)(and maybe other amp stacks like xampp....) is something that i coded after a friend of mine asked me if there is a fantastico installer for WAMP, which was funny since he only needed it to install WordPress. 

The i figured Installing WordPress is a very simple flow of 
* downloading the latest version.
* extracting the downloaded zip file.
* creating a new database.
